Explaining, Supporting  Defending a Theory of Mind-Body. 
Write a 4-5page essay (double spaced/approx.1,200-1,500 words) in which you do:
1. FIRST - • State and explain what you think is the most plausible theory of Mind-Body - either some specific version of Mind-Body Dualism or of Mind-Body Physicalism - such as two-way interactive substance dualism, or identity physicalism.
• The very first sentence of your paper should be: "In this paper I will explain and argue for ____________________________   _."   (where the name of the theory goes into the blank).  
• Be sure to clearly explain what that theory involves. 
2.SECOND - Make the positive case for your theory.  
• Give multiple reasons in support of your theory, including at least one explicit positive argument in numbered premise/conclusion format.* 
• Then explain the argument in your own words.  
• Explain why it is a good argument.
• Consider and respond to any objections that might be raised against your positive argument(s) or against any of the positive reasons that you gave.
3. THIRD – Defend your theory against attacks.  
• Discuss possible objections to your theory, including at least one negative argument against your theory. (i.e., an argument that tries to show your theory is wrong, not just an objection to your own positive argument).
•Defend your theory against that negative argument.  Explain why you believe it does not succeed in showing yo代 写PHI 107 - 2nd ESSAY/GRADED WRITING ASSIGNMENT Fall 2024R

• Review why on balance, your theory is overall the best one.
